# SBA-316

## To-Do List App

For my skills-based assessment for the 316 module, I built a To-Do List app that allows users to create and manage tasks with full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, and even leverages **localStorage** so tasks actually get saved in the browser, enabling users to revisit their task list at any time. I accomplished these functionalities through the use of DOM manipulation, so that tasks on the page get updated in a smooth manner without the need to refresh the page.
